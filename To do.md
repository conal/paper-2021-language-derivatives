## To do

*   Related work
*   Introduction, including clear statement of contributions
*   Polish the abstract, especially the second/middle paragraph.
*   Clarify tries as "automatic differentiation".
*   Mention potential optimizations for regular expressions and tries.
*   `starʳ`
*   Define language star via `mapⱽ` and `All`.
*   Consider exposing level polymorphism in the talk & paper.
    It's there just under the surface.

Less important:

*   Fourier theorem?
*   Reconcile talk font vs paper font.
    I don't know how they come to differ.
*   Future work:
    *   Could I automate the transition from lemmas to implementation via rewrite rules?
        I'd have to suppress normalization, which would seem to break many proofs.
