## To do

*   Polish the abstract, especially the second/middle paragraph.
*   Mention potential optimizations.
*   Future work:
    *   Could I automate the transition from lemmas to implementation via rewrite rules?
        I'd have to suppress normalization, which would seem to break many proofs.
*   Reconcile talk font vs paper font.
    I don't know how they come to differ.
